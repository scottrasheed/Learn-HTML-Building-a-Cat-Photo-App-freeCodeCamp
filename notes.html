Step 1: Changing Text in an HTML Element
What I did:
Replaced the text inside the <h1> element from "Hello World" to "CatPhotoApp".

What I learned:

HTML elements have opening tags (like <h1>) and closing tags (like </h1>).

The content between these tags is what gets displayed in the browser.

You can change the displayed text by editing the content between the tags.

Before:

html
Copy
Edit
<h1>Hello World</h1>
After:

html
Copy
Edit
<h1>CatPhotoApp</h1>

Step 2: Adding a Subheading with <h2>
What I did:
Added an <h2> element below the existing <h1> element with the text "Cat Photos".

What I learned:

Heading elements (<h1> through <h6>) represent different levels of importance in a page’s structure.

<h1> is the most important and should only be used once per page.

<h2> to <h6> are used for subheadings, with decreasing importance.

New HTML:

html
Copy
Edit
<h1>CatPhotoApp</h1>
<h2>Cat Photos</h2>

Step 3: Creating a Paragraph with <p>
What I did:
Added a <p> element below the <h2> to display a short paragraph of text.

What I learned:

The <p> element is used for paragraphs, which are blocks of text on a webpage.

Paragraphs help structure content in a readable and meaningful way.

Always place the <p> tag where you want text content to appear, usually under a heading.

New HTML:

html
Copy
Edit
<h2>Cat Photos</h2>
<p>Everyone loves cute cats online!</p>

Step 4: Adding Comments in HTML
What I did:
Inserted a comment right above the <p> element with a message reminding me to add a link to cat photos later.

What I learned:

HTML comments begin with <!-- and end with -->.

Comments don’t show up in the browser but are super helpful for leaving notes or temporarily disabling code.

Common practice includes using comments for TODOs, reminders, or explanations.

New HTML:

html
Copy
Edit
<!-- TODO: Add link to cat photos -->
<p>Everyone loves cute cats online!</p>
